# OhMyProfessors - Executive Brief
**One-Page Strategic Overview**

## 🎯 Mission
Empower Australian students to make informed unit selections by providing transparent, legally-compliant professor ratings.

## 💡 The Opportunity

**Market Gap:**
- StudentVIP reviews *subjects*, not *professors*
- RateMyProfessors ignores Australian defamation law
- University SETU surveys are private and generic
- **Result:** Students gamble on $30K+ degrees without knowing *who* teaches

**Our Solution:**
First Australian professor rating platform built for Stage 2 Defamation Reforms with verified student reviews.
