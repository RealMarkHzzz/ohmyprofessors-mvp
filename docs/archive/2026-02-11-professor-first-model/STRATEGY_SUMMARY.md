### Go-to-Market Strategy

#### Channel Prioritization

**Tier 1: Organic Community (70% effort)**
1. University subreddits (r/adelaide, r/unimelb)
2. Discord/Facebook course groups
3. Word-of-mouth viral loop (K-factor > 1.2 target)
4. SEO for long-tail keywords ("[Professor Name] review")

**Tier 2: Content Marketing (20% effort)**
5. TikTok/Instagram edu-tainment (3 posts/week)
6. YouTube long-form value (1 video every 2 weeks)
7. Blog/newsletter (weekly student success stories)

**Tier 3: Paid Acquisition (10% effort, 20% budget)**
8. Google Search ads (enrollment periods only)
9. Meta ads (geo-fenced universities)
10. Reddit promoted posts (native AMAs)

**Target CAC:** <$20 per verified user  
**LTV:** $50-$100 (3-year student lifecycle)

#### Partnership Strategy
- **Student Unions:** 5 partnerships by Month 6
- **University Newspapers:** 8 editorial partnerships by Month 12
- **Course Societies:** 20 discipline-specific promotions by Month 12
- **Third-Party Apps:** 3 timetable/study planner integrations by Month 18

---

### Competitive Moats

1. **Legal Moat (12-18 month lead)**
   - Proprietary AI moderation trained on Australian defamation law
   - First-mover advantage in post-reform era

2. **Network Effects (Compounding)**
   - 10,000 reviews = defensible threshold
   - More reviews → more value → more users → more reviews

3. **University Partnerships (Lock-In)**
   - B2B contracts create switching costs
   - Data integration into university systems

4. **Brand Trust (Reputation)**
   - "OhMyProfessors = professor ratings" (like Google = search)
   - 24 months to establish brand dominance

5. **Data Advantage (Proprietary)**
   - 3 years of historical trends impossible to replicate
   - Predictive analytics from cumulative data

---

### Risk Mitigation

#### Top 5 Risks & Contingencies

**Risk 1: Defamation Suit (30% probability)**
- Mitigation: $50K legal fund, $2M insurance, 72-hour takedown SLA
- Contingency: Safe harbor defense, settle quickly if losing

**Risk 2: University Opposition (40% probability)**
- Mitigation: Frame as quality assurance, offer free B2B dashboard
- Contingency: Alternative verification (student ID upload)

**Risk 3: Competitor Clone (60% probability)**
- Mitigation: Speed to 10,000 reviews, lock in partnerships
- Contingency: Double down on Australian-specific features

**Risk 4: Low Contribution Rate (30% probability)**
- Mitigation: Gamification, incentives, timely prompts
- Contingency: Paid review bounties ($2/review)

**Risk 5: Moderation Failure (20% probability)**
- Mitigation: Multi-layer moderation, weekly audits
- Contingency: Halt reviews until system fixed, ratings-only pivot

---

### Decision Framework

#### Pivot Triggers (Any 2 = Pivot Required)
1. <5% review contribution rate after 6 months
2. >10% takedown request rate
3. Successful defamation suit with liability
4. <500 monthly active users after 12 months
5. Legal/regulatory ban on professor reviews

#### Perseverance Signals (All 3 = Continue)
1. NPS > 40
2. Review contribution > 15%
3. Zero legal liabilities

#### Pre-Planned Pivot Options
- **Plan A:** Subject-only reviews (StudentVIP model)
- **Plan B:** B2B-only university feedback tool
- **Plan C:** International expansion (NZ/UK same legal landscape)
